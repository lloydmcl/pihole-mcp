# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this MCP server, please report it **privately** using [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/lloydmcl/pihole-mcp/security/advisories/new) rather than the public issue tracker.

Please include:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g. credential exposure, injection, authentication bypass)
- Location in source code (file path and line number if possible)
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact (especially regarding Pi-hole API credential handling)
- Suggested fix (if any)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgement:** within 48 hours
- **Assessment:** severity and impact evaluated within 1 week
- **Fix:** developed in a private branch
- **Release:** patch version published with security advisory

## Security Considerations

This MCP server handles Pi-hole API credentials. Users should:

- **Use environment variables** for `PIHOLE_URL` and `PIHOLE_PASSWORD` — never hardcode credentials
- **Use application passwords** instead of the main admin password where possible (can be revoked independently)
- **Use HTTPS** when connecting to Pi-hole over untrusted networks
- **Restrict network access** to the Pi-hole instance using firewall rules
- **Keep dependencies updated** — enable Dependabot or run `go get -u` regularly

## Scope

The following are in scope for security reports:

- Credential leakage (Pi-hole passwords exposed in logs, errors, or responses)
- Authentication bypass in the session management logic
- Injection vulnerabilities in API request construction
- Denial of service through resource exhaustion

Out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities in Pi-hole itself (report to [Pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/security))
- Vulnerabilities in the mcp-go SDK (report to [mark3labs/mcp-go](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go))
